how to save dates in database and transfer to client:

 Because integers are easier to query, index, and more space efficient than strings, dates are usually stored as 64-bit integers such as a unix epoch with milliseconds.
 Databases will convert any datetime into a UTC epoch to store internally.
 Unlike most databases, there is no native datetime data type in JSON thus dates will have to be stored as JSON number or a JSON string. Either works, but standards should be followed meaning a date string should be formatted as one of the ISO 8601 formats. Date numbers should be stored as Unix Epoch time with the API contract specifying seconds or milliseconds.

Pusher and strip apis use EPOCH time.
