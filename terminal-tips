Visual studio code zsh: 
  1) list history range: 
       history 500 - to see last 500 commands
       
  2) write output of any command: 
       npm list --depth 500 > npm-list.txt
   
  3) if you have created a json file and later on zipped it and got removed the extensions .json.zip from it, then to see real json you have to put the extensions back on file and then unzip it.
